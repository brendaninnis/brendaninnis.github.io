Tonight I am deploying this Jekyll powered blog to GitHub pages and setting up my domain.

This blog is a place for me to share things I have learned with the world, to document my
coding experiments and side project and to serve as my about page on the web.

I remember fondly internet 1.0 when personal webpages were in vogue. At that time I was
learning about HTML and was facinated with the technology. As a kid I never really knew
where to go from there. Now that blogs are a "must have" for anyone wanting to be
present on the web, I realize that I should have valued my little personal web page
just as much as any other website I visited.

This is going to be the page I always wanted to build.
